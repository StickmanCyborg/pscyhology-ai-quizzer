# ai psychology quizzer

basically it's just ai powered flashcards. instead of memorizing each specific word on a flashcard, making each definition be generated by ai each time adds variety to the possible definitions you may encounter for a word, leading to you actually understand what it means rather than simple memorization.
this can work for a variety of subjects but im just using it for psychology

currently there are 46 words and the ui is absolute trash

**please don't spam the ai, it needs 6 seconds before you can call it again, be patient and wait a few seconds a few seconds after you press space and the input field appears. I will add a cooldown timer to avoid spam later.**
